<h3>What is Abstraction?</h3>
<h4>Answer version 1.1</h4>

Abstraction is a system for helping teenagers making money, and for Neighbors to get help for different chores around the house.
<br>
Good examples of work that teenagers might help with: <br>
* Washing car inside and outside<br>
* Mowing lawn<br>
* Selling items in garage on ebay<br>
* Organize garage<br>
* Cleaning garage<br>
* Vacuuming house<br>
* Make garden nicer<br>
* Clean windows<br>
* Paint fence<br>
* Paint room<br>
* Help with moving<br><br>
Perhaps the biggest advantage to you if you're a teenager is that you start
gaining work skills, and you're getting paid in the process. Gaining work
skills can become hugely beneficial later in life, as you have a much better
understanding of what customers want. Also, once you start making your own
money, you gain independence and self-esteem. Try it, it feels good.
<br>

Furhter down the road we might also teach our customers about money, 
so that our customers can gain additional financial independence and 
control over their own lifes.
<br>

At Abstraction we strongly believe that trade enables win-win situations 
where all parties involved are better off for interacting with each other.
<br>
We do not believe the nonsense that trade is a zero-sum game.
